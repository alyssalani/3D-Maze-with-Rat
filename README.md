# 3D-Maze-with-Rat

User may use the left, right, and center button on a mouse to control the triangle navigating through the maze.
User may also use the keyboard arrows to control the triangle.

't' key sets the mouse into top view: default view.
'p' key sets the mouse in new perspective view in order to view the 3D quality of the maze.
'r' key sets the mouse into rat's view and allows the user to navigate the maze from the perspective of the triangle. 

There are image examples of the different views. The image names are: top_view.png, perspective_view.png, and rat_view.png


Most of Graphics.cpp, though not all, was given under the direction of professor Bart Stander, so that file will not be a good indicator of my coding abilities. 

Files with solely my work:
  - Rat.h
  - Rat.cpp
  - Maze.h
  - Maze.cpp
